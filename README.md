node-playground
===============

A simple web server based on [node-staticp](https://github.com/pwfisher/node-staticp),
an extension of [node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static).
With extra comments to help the novice node programmer.

See [Getting started with Node.js](http://pwfisher.com/2013/node-static-forever.html) for a quick environment setup.

**tl;dr**: run this server with [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for dev and [forever](https://github.com/indexzero/forever) for production.
